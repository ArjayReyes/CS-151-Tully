### Presentation
Darrel 
1. Created barebones UI
    1. Made frame not resizable so that it’s easier to make the project/screens prettier through some “manual” or hard-coded manipulations of the components
    2. Each page used layouts including (not in any particular order):
        1. BorderLayout
        2. GridLayout
        3. FlowLayout
        4. GridBagLayout
    3. Most pages have JPanels to store the components and allow for easier component manipulation
        1. Some panels have panels within panels
    5. Button functionalities so that each button leads to a new screen
        1. The transition to each new page hides the current one and creates the new screen
    6. Return button for each page so that users can go back to the previous screen
    7. Each page aside from the account, inventory, and waitlist screen displays the “Tully Library” text
    8. Each username/password textfield initially isn’t editable and is grayed out with default text
        1. Once user clicks the textfield, they can type whatever they want and the default text disappears
    9. Main screen where users can choose on whether they want to signup or login
    10. Signup Screen
        1. Allow users to enter username and password in text fields
        2. Checkbox to display password
        3. Submit button that doesn’t do anything except go to a blank screen
        4. Hovering over the password text field or the checkbox tells the user what they need to do/put for those components
    11. Login Screen
        1. Allow users to enter their username and password
        2. Submit button that doesn’t do anything except go to Library screen
    12. Library Screen
        1. A scroll box with temporary buttons with dummy information that don’t do anything
        2. Account button to access the user’s account
        3. “Available Books” text above the scroll box
    13. Account Screen
        1. Welcome text displaying dummy name for the user
        2. Book fee text displaying dummy fee
        3. Pay fee button that doesn’t do anything
        4. Inventory button that leads to the book inventory screen
        5. Waitlist button that leads to the waitlisted books screen
    14. Inventory Screen
        1. Scroll box with dummy buttons that don’t do anything
        2. “Borrowed Books” text above the scroll box
    15. Waitlisted Books Screen
        1. Scroll box with dummy buttons that don’t do anything
        2. “Waitlisted Books” text above the scroll box

Arjay
1. Created the Book class
    1. Utilized in both Library and User classes.
    2. Contained information such as title, author, ISBN, and returnDate at the time.

Arjay - File I/O/Backend
1. File I/O
    1. Worked with a team to help the library application read and write .txt files for book and user databases.
        1. Appended new users and books to databases.
        2. Can delete users and books if ID is provided.
    2. File I/O within GUI:
        1. Sign-up: Users created must be appended to userDatabase.txt.
        2. Available Books: 
            1. Borrow - if the user borrows a book, update userDatabase.txt and add a returnDate in bookDatabase.txt.
            2. Waitlist - if the user borrows a book, update userDatabase.txt.
        3. Account Screen:
            1. For user’s borrowed books list, users can return, which removes the book from the user, and extend the due date which extends the returnDate by 7 days; assume that the library is forgiving of due dates in this case or that the user has an excuse for overdue books.
            2. For user’s waitlisted books list, any books available and subsequently borrowed are updated into the file.
        4. Admin:
            1. Add book - appends book to the bookDatabase.txt
            2. Remove book - removes book from the bookDatabse.txt; no white space.
            3. Remove user - removes user from userDatabase.txt; no white space.
    3. Worked closely with Darrel to fulfill functionality requirements for file I/O, and with Matthew for custom exception handling.
2. Code reevaluation
    1. After brainstorming with the team, we had to add additional parameters for our User and Book classes, in particular, we had to create an additional ArrayList class for our Users that stores any ‘waitlisted’ books that the user wants.
    2. Other miscellaneous and minor changes made were:
        1. Booleans for Book class that check if it is borrowed or waitlisted.
        2. Using LocalDate instead of the deprecated Date library for Book.
3. Project Diagram Update
    3. Updated Sequence and Class diagrams to showcase updated classes/parameters used.

## Problem

Tully Library has contracted our startup company, 5X-if-else, to create an intuitive library management system by the end of Q4 2023. The library management system must incorporate object-oriented programming concepts, Java’s Graphical User Interface (GUI) capabilities, and exception handling.

Previous works:
* Not applicable.

Assumptions/Operating Environment/Intended Usage:
* Assumed that the library has “been in operation” with a premade database of books and users.
* Users can waitlist a book if it is already borrowed with a separate page in their Account listing waitlisted books instead of having to scroll down and find the books themselves.
* Date can be changed as a way to simulate time passing through the menu screen.
* Admin button that can add/remove books and remove users using their ID.
    * We opted for this rudimentary method due to time constraints and to meet project requirements.

## Diagrams

## Functionality

In order to meet with the requirements listed by Tully Library, our program must implement the JavaFX/Java Swing class in order to create an interactive and simple interface for users to access the database. The database itself must also be run using object oriented concepts such as, File I/O, polymorphism, and exception handling. Emphasis on exception handling; used to deal with invalid user inputs, program errors, and stackoverflow. Extensive testing will be necessary to ensure all operations are functioning and exceptions are all handled.

## Operations

Borrow book - The Library class will have a UI that allows the user to click on a “borrow” button next to the book that appears on the visual list of books in the UI.

Sign In - Users can sign in with a username & password using a fill-in form.

Sign Out - Users can sign out using a button in the UI.

Pay Fees - The user can check what fees they have through their account UI and pay their fees.

Extend - Users can extend the time they’re borrowing their book(s) through buttons on their account.

Create Account - Users can create an account in the Library UI with a username & password; username has to be unique.

Waitlist - Users can be put on a waitlist to borrow a specific book that is already borrowed by someone else.

Show books - show users the books they’ve borrowed and ones that are overdue.

Return Books - Return a book and remove it from a user’s account

Add Book - Add a book to the database given its title, author, and ISBN

Remove Book - Remove a book from the database given its ISBN

Remove User - Remove a user from the database given their ID

Modify the Date - Allows users to reset the date or increment it by a certain number of days

## Solution

After working on difficult hurdles, our startup 5X-if-else delivered a suitable application for Tully Library. While it has its rough edges, an interface where users can borrow and interact with the library’s database was provided which edits two database files containing user and books. Some exception handling was provided primarily for our login and signup functionality for new users. Overall, while there were obstacles our team worked to the best of our abilities to deliver an application that meets the project's requirements.
